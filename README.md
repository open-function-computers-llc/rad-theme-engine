## About

The purpose of this package is to enable developers to use the familiar model-view-controller pattern in the creation of WordPress themes. This is accomplished by keeping HTML and PHP code as seperated as possible and adding convenient methods to organize data before itâ€™s sent to the view controllers. Querying for posts, rendering menus, handling taxonomies and all the other essential parts of developing a WordPress theme are now easier than ever with the __RAD Theme Engine__.


## Quick Start
Inside of your site's `wp-content/themes` folder, run the following command to create a new __Rad Theme Engine__ project.

```
composer create-project open-function-computers-llc/wp-theme <theme-name>
```

Next, enter your new theme's folder and run `npm install` to get dependencies.
```
cd <theme-name>
npm install
```

And that's it! Read about advanced installations and asset bundling on [the docs](https://rad.ofco.cloud/).
